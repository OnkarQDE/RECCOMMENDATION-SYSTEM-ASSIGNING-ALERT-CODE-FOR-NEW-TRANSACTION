# RECCOMMENDATION-SYSTEM-PIPELINE-FOR-ASSIGNING-ALERT-CODE-FOR-NEW-TRANSACTION 
Recommendation System

This repository provides a recommendation system pipeline designed to assign alert codes to new transactions using cosine similarity. The pipeline leverages the power of cosine similarity to measure the similarity between two datasets: the alerts dataset and the transaction dataset. By training the cosine algorithm on the alerts dataset, it can effectively identify patterns and similarities between historical alerts and new transactions.

Features
Data Processing: The pipeline includes modules for pre-processing and cleaning both the alerts dataset and the transaction dataset. This ensures data quality and consistency before performing cosine similarity calculations.

Cosine Similarity: Cosine similarity is used as the metric to compare the alerts dataset with the transaction dataset. By measuring the cosine angle between vectors representing the transactions, the pipeline can identify the similarity between new transactions and historical alerts.

Recommendation Engine: The recommendation system employs the cosine similarity scores to generate recommendations for assigning alert codes to new transactions. By ranking the transactions based on their similarity to historical alerts, the pipeline identifies potentially suspicious or fraudulent transactions.

Alert Code Assignment: Based on the recommendations provided by the recommendation engine, the pipeline assigns an appropriate alert code to each new transaction. These alert codes help prioritize and categorize transactions for further investigation or action.

Benefits
Accurate Similarity Measurements: Cosine similarity is a powerful metric that accurately captures the similarity between two datasets, enabling the pipeline to make reliable recommendations for alert code assignment.

Efficient Fraud Detection: By leveraging cosine similarity, the pipeline efficiently identifies potentially fraudulent transactions by comparing them to historical alerts, reducing the need for manual inspection of every individual transaction.

Customizability: The recommendation system pipeline can be customized and adapted to fit specific business requirements. You can adjust the parameters and thresholds used in the cosine similarity calculations to fine-tune the system's performance.
